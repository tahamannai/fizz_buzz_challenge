3 The if keyword is used to check if an expression is true. If it is true, a statement is then executed.     The statement can be a single statement or a compound statement. A compound statement consists of multiple statements enclosed by the block. A block is code enclosed by the end keyword. The then keyword is optional.

    puts "Driving license issued"
else

    puts "Driving license not permitted"
end
